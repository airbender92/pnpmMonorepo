The `composite: true` option in TypeScript enables composite projects, which are useful for projects that have multiple local packages with dependencies between them. When enabled, TypeScript treats the project as a composite project, allowing it to correctly resolve dependencies between local packages.

Let's create a simple composite project with two TypeScript files and demonstrate how `composite: true` works:

Suppose we have two TypeScript files, `utils.ts` and `app.ts`, representing a simple utility module and an application module, respectively.

**utils.ts:**

```typescript
// utils.ts

export function double(x: number): number {
  return x * 2;
}
```

**app.ts:**

```typescript
// app.ts

import { double } from './utils';

const result = double(5);
console.log(result);
```

Now, let's create a `tsconfig.json` file in the root directory with `"composite": true`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "composite": true,
    "outDir": "./dist"
  },
  "include": ["*.ts"]
}
```

In this configuration, `"composite": true` is specified.

Now, let's compile the TypeScript files using the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`):

```bash
tsc
```

After running this command, TypeScript will create an incremental build, and it will treat the project as a composite project due to the `"composite": true` option.

Additionally, TypeScript will generate a `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` file in the root directory. This file contains information about the project's structure and dependencies, which TypeScript uses to perform incremental builds efficiently.

The output files (`utils.js` and `app.js`) will be placed in the specified output directory (`dist`). The `app.js` file will contain the correct import statement to `utils.js`, thanks to the composite project setup, which ensures correct dependency resolution between local packages.


Since the result of a composite project compilation might vary depending on the setup and configuration, I'll provide the expected output structure and content based on the provided example.

Given the `utils.ts` and `app.ts` files and the `tsconfig.json` configuration with `"composite": true`, the expected compiled result will be as follows:

**Compiled files:**

1. **utils.js**: Transpiled JavaScript file for the `utils.ts` module.
2. **app.js**: Transpiled JavaScript file for the `app.ts` module.
3. **tsconfig.tsbuildinfo**: TypeScript build information file generated for the composite project.

**Compiled content:**

**utils.js:**
```javascript
// utils.js

"use strict";
exports.__esModule = true;
exports.double = void 0;
function double(x) {
    return x * 2;
}
exports.double = double;
```

**app.js:**
```javascript
// app.js

"use strict";
exports.__esModule = true;
var utils_1 = require("./utils");
var result = utils_1.double(5);
console.log(result);
```

This is the compiled JavaScript output based on the provided TypeScript files and the configuration with `"composite": true`. The `utils.js` file contains the transpiled code for the `double` function, and the `app.js` file contains the transpiled code for the `app.ts` module, which imports and uses the `double` function from `utils.js`.

Additionally, the `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` file stores information about the project's structure and dependencies, aiding TypeScript in performing efficient incremental builds for the composite project.
