The `"noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true` compiler option in TypeScript enforces checking for fallthrough cases in switch statements. Fallthrough occurs when one case in a switch statement does not include a `break`, `return`, or `throw` statement, causing control flow to pass to the next case.

Let's demonstrate the use of `"noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true` with an example:

Suppose you have a TypeScript file named `fallthroughExample.ts` with the following content:

```typescript
// fallthroughExample.ts

function printDay(dayOfWeek: number) {
  let dayName: string;

  switch (dayOfWeek) {
    case 0:
      dayName = 'Sunday';
    case 1:
      dayName = 'Monday';
    case 2:
      dayName = 'Tuesday';
    case 3:
      dayName = 'Wednesday';
    case 4:
      dayName = 'Thursday';
    case 5:
      dayName = 'Friday';
    case 6:
      dayName = 'Saturday';
  }

  console.log(`Today is ${dayName}`);
}

printDay(3); // Example usage
```

In this example, each case in the switch statement assigns a value to the `dayName` variable. However, there are no `break` statements after each case, potentially causing fallthrough behavior where control flow continues to the next case even after a case has been matched.

Now, let's create a `tsconfig.json` file with `"noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "outDir": "./dist"
  },
  "include": ["*.ts"]
}
```

In this configuration, `"noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true` is specified.

Now, let's compile the TypeScript file using the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`):

```bash
tsc
```

After running this command, TypeScript will report an error for each potential fallthrough case in the switch statement. The error messages will indicate that fallthrough behavior is detected, and it's recommended to add a `break`, `return`, or `throw` statement after each case to explicitly specify the intended control flow. This helps prevent unintended behavior and improves code clarity and maintainability.
