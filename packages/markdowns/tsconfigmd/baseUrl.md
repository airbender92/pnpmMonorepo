The `"baseUrl"` property in a TypeScript `tsconfig.json` file specifies the base directory to resolve non-relative module imports. 

When TypeScript encounters an import statement without a leading dot (`.`) or forward slash (`/`), it looks for the module starting from the directory specified by `"baseUrl"`. This is particularly useful when working with absolute paths in your TypeScript project, as it allows you to specify import paths relative to the base directory instead of having to provide the full path.

Here's an explanation with an example:

Suppose you have the following project structure:

```
project/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Button.ts
│   └── utils/
│       └── logger.ts
├── tsconfig.json
└── ...
```

And your `tsconfig.json` file has the following configuration:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./src",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "target": "es5"
  }
}
```

With this setup, when you import a module in your TypeScript files without a leading dot or forward slash, TypeScript will look for the module relative to the `src` directory, which is specified by the `"baseUrl"` property.

For example, in a file `Button.ts` within the `components` directory, you can import the `logger.ts` module like this:

```typescript
import { log } from 'utils/logger'; // TypeScript will resolve this to './src/utils/logger'
```

The `"baseUrl"` property simplifies module imports by allowing you to specify paths relative to a base directory without the need for long relative paths or complex configurations.
